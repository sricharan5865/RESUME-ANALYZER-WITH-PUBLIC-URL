Enhance the TalentFlow HR Recruitment platform with four improvements: filtered Excel export with stage selection dialog, smarter AI/RAG search that accepts a job description and scores/ranks candidates against it with JD-tailored questions, de-duplicated recruitment logs that prevent same-stage entries, and standardized HR cold-calling questions prepended to the question bank.

> IMPORTANT: Existing Code Rules (from project AGENTS.md):
> - Do NOT delete or overwrite existing web pages, components, views, or routing files.
> - Preserve all existing functionality — these are additive enhancements.
> - When calling LLMs (OpenRouter, Gemini, Ollama), always set max_tokens / maxOutputTokens to at least 8000/8192 to prevent truncation.
> - The system uses MongoDB via Mongoose. In-memory vector index for RAG.
> - The project runs on Node.js (server) + Vite/React (client).
> - The backend AI provider is configured in Settings (Gemini, Claude, OpenAI, or Ollama). Use the existing callAIProvider() function in geminiParser.js for any new LLM calls.

## Requirements

### R1. Export to Excel — Stage Filter Dialog
When the "Export to Excel" button is clicked on the Pipeline Kanban page (client/src/components/PipelineBoard.jsx), instead of immediately exporting all candidates, show a modal/dialog that lets the user choose which pipeline stages to include in the export. The options should be checkboxes for: Inbox, Shortlist, Interview, Offered, Rejected (and an "All" option). Only candidates matching the selected stages should be exported. The current export function (handleExport at lines 29-57) exports sortedCandidates without any stage filtering — this must be enhanced to filter by the selected stages before passing to exportToCSV().

### R2. AI Search — JD-Based Candidate Scoring, Ranking & Question Generation
In the AI Search page (client/src/components/RAGSearch.jsx), enhance the "Ask AI" mode so that when a user pastes a job description with required qualifications:

1. Find candidates via RAG: Use the existing vector search (searchResumes() in server/ragService.js) to find candidates whose resume content is semantically relevant to the JD text.

2. Score & Rank against the JD: For each matched candidate, use the existing scoring model (scoreCandidate() in server/geminiParser.js) or a similar AI call to analyze the candidate's qualities against the JD requirements and produce a match score (0-100), matching skills, missing skills, and an explanation. Return the candidates ranked by this score.

3. Generate JD-tailored interview questions: For the top matched candidates, automatically generate new interview questions that are tailored to the job description (using the existing generateQuestionsForCandidate() function which already accepts a job description parameter). The AI Search results should show these JD-specific questions or indicate that questions have been regenerated for the JD context.

The backend endpoint for this can be a new route (e.g. POST /api/rag/jd-search) or an enhancement to the existing /api/rag/ask endpoint. The frontend should display the ranked candidates with their JD match scores, matching/missing skills, and the generated questions.

### R3. Recruitment Log — No Duplicate Same-Stage Entries
In the candidate stage change endpoint (server.js PATCH /api/candidates/:id/stage around line 1792), add a guard so that if the new stage is identical to the current stage, the server returns the candidate unchanged without adding a history entry. This prevents duplicate log entries like "Moved from Shortlist to Shortlist". Also add the same guard on the frontend side in PipelineBoard.jsx (handleDrop around line 132) and CandidateDetails.jsx (handleStageSelect) so the API is not called at all when the stage hasn't changed.

### R4. HR Questions — Standardized Cold-Calling Questions + Tailored Questions (14 total)
Modify the HR question generation in server/geminiParser.js so that the final hrQuestions array contains exactly 14 questions (not 7). The first 7 must always be these fixed cold-calling screening questions (with generic sample answers):

1. "Are you looking for a job?"
2. "How many years of experience do you have?"
3. "What is the reason for your job change?"
4. "What is your current CTC?"
5. "What is your expected CTC?"
6. "What is your notice period?"
7. "Is your notice period negotiable? (If the notice period is 30, 60, or 90 days)"

The remaining 7 should be the AI-generated, candidate-personalized HR questions that the system already produces (from mapAnalysisToQuestions() lines 757-876 and the LLM prompt section 5). Update the mapAnalysisToQuestions() function to prepend the 7 fixed questions and then append up to 7 AI-generated ones. The CandidateDetails.jsx UI that renders HR questions should display all 14 properly.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Export to Excel
- [ ] Clicking "Export to Excel" on the Pipeline Kanban shows a stage selection dialog before exporting
- [ ] The dialog has checkboxes for Inbox, Shortlist, Interview, Offered, Rejected, and an "All" toggle
- [ ] Selecting specific stages and confirming exports only candidates in those stages
- [ ] Selecting "All" or all checkboxes exports the same data as the old behavior
- [ ] The dialog can be cancelled without exporting

### AI Search with JD Scoring
- [ ] Pasting a job description into the Ask AI search box triggers a JD-based candidate search
- [ ] Each matched candidate is scored (0-100) against the JD with matching skills, missing skills, and explanation displayed
- [ ] Candidates are ranked by their JD match score (highest first)
- [ ] JD-tailored interview questions are generated or available for the top matched candidates
- [ ] The UI clearly shows the JD analysis results distinct from regular search results

### Recruitment Log De-duplication
- [ ] Dragging a candidate to the same column they are already in does NOT create a new history entry
- [ ] Changing the stage dropdown in CandidateDetails to the same value does NOT create a log
- [ ] The server endpoint returns the candidate unchanged when old stage equals new stage
- [ ] Actual stage changes (e.g., Inbox to Shortlist) still log correctly

### HR Questions
- [ ] Every newly parsed candidate has exactly 14 HR questions (not 7)
- [ ] The first 7 questions are always the standardized cold-calling questions in the exact order specified
- [ ] Questions 8-14 are AI-generated and personalized to the candidate's resume
- [ ] The HR questions section in the candidate profile UI displays all 14 questions properly
- [ ] Previously parsed candidates are unaffected (their existing questions remain)

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- After changes, start the dev server (npm run dev in client, node server.js in server) and verify no startup errors
- Upload a test resume and verify 14 HR questions are generated with the first 7 being the cold-calling script

### Manual Verification
- Test Export to Excel: click button then verify dialog appears, select Shortlist only, verify exported CSV contains only Shortlist candidates
- Test AI Search: paste a GIS Analyst job description, verify candidates appear ranked with scores, matching/missing skills, and tailored questions
- Test duplicate logs: drag a candidate to its current column, verify no new log entry appears
- Test HR questions: open a newly parsed candidate, verify first 7 are the cold-calling questions

The goal is to build and implement comprehensive automated E2E tests and perform an audit on the duplicate candidate upload and resolution pipeline (Update, Delete & Re-import, Delete Only, and Cancel) on the existing recruitment platform.

Working directory: c:\Users\sri charan\Documents\projects\hr recruter
Integrity mode: development

## Requirements

### R1. E2E Tests for Duplicate Resolution Options
Create automated E2E tests using Vitest to verify all four duplicate resolution choices:
1. Update: Overwrites existing candidate fields and resume URL, preserving the candidate ID.
2. Delete Existing & Import New: Deletes the old candidate profile and indexes, then parses and imports the new resume as a fresh candidate.
3. Delete Existing Only (Halt Import): Deletes the existing candidate and does not import the new file.
4. Cancel (Discard Uploaded File): Discards the incoming temp file and leaves the database unmodified.

### R2. Verification of Ingestion Log Statuses
Verify that the IngestionLog status is correctly updated to 'success', 'cancelled', or 'failed' according to the selected resolution action.

## Acceptance Criteria

### E2E Test Suite
- [ ] Implement automated test cases in `tests/e2e/duplicateResolution.test.js` covering all 4 resolution actions.
- [ ] The test server should mock LLM parser calls correctly for duplicate scenarios.
- [ ] Running `npm run test:e2e` runs all tests, including the new tests, successfully.

Optimize the light mode color branding, scheming, and palette of the TalentFlow web application by researching popular sites and running an iterative design-evaluation loop until the design scores 9/10.

Working directory: c:/Users/sri charan/Documents/projects/hr recruter
Integrity mode: development

## Requirements

### R1. Color Research & Selection
The team must research and analyze the light mode color palettes of at least 10–15 industry-leading web applications (e.g., Vercel, Linear, Stripe, Tailwind CSS, GitHub, Framer, Figma, Notion, Slack, Shopify) to identify patterns in text contrast, border structure, card shading, and accent harmony.

### R2. Color Palette Implementation
Update the `.light-theme` CSS variables in c:/Users/sri charan/Documents/projects/hr recruter/client/src/index.css to apply the optimized scheme. No functional code or JSX layout files should be modified.

### R3. Iterative Feedback Loop (AI Critic)
Configure an independent AI Critic Agent equipped with a strict design evaluation rubric (assessing text contrast, visual hierarchy, color harmony, and overall premium polish). The critic must rate the updated palette on a scale of 1–10. The team must loop, research, adjust, and re-evaluate until the design scores a 9/10 or higher.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Research & Analysis
- Document the light mode analysis of 10-15 popular websites in a markdown research report, outlining their color choices.

### High Contrast & Cohesion
- No washed-out colors or low-contrast text elements.
- Cards, sidebars, and main content panes must have crisp, clear, modern division lines.

### Iteration & Rating
- The critique history of each iteration loop must be documented in a log file, showing the progressive scores.
- The final palette iteration must receive a score of 9/10 or higher from the independent AI Critic agent.

Optimize the recruitment platform (TalentFlow) by refining general candidate question generation (concise/professional), isolating JD questions to on-demand generation only with a dedicated 'Construct questions according to JD Match' button, and optimizing the LLM prompts for Ollama.

Working directory: c:\Users\sri charan\Documents\projects\hr recruter
Integrity mode: development

## Requirements

### R1. Professional and Concise General Candidate Questions
- General candidate questions (`hrQuestions` and `technicalQuestions` mapped during resume parse/analysis) must remain highly professional and technically challenging, but strictly short, direct, and under 15-20 words.
- They must not contain verbose introductory prefixes detailing candidate history.
- The standard screening questions must be kept professional and not silly.

### R2. On-Demand JD Match Questions & "Construct questions according to JD Match" Button
- JD-relevant questions must **never** be generated automatically on candidate ingestion (manual upload or email resolve).
- When a candidate details card is opened in a JD context (either from the JD Match search results, or when a job is selected and the global "rank according to job description" toggle is ON), a button with the text `"Construct questions according to JD Match"` must be rendered if JD questions have not yet been generated for that candidate-job combination.
- Clicking the button must trigger the API call to generate the JD-relevant questions on-demand.
- The button text must be exactly `"Construct questions according to JD Match"`.

### R3. Optimized Ollama Prompts for JD Questions
- The prompt sent to the LLM (specifically Ollama) for JD-specific question generation must be highly optimized, compact, and context-stripped to minimize pre-processing latency and ensure fast generation.
- The generated JD questions must also be concise, direct, and short (under 15-20 words).

## Acceptance Criteria

### Question Formatting & Styling
- [ ] General HR and Technical questions are short, direct, and concise (strictly under 15-20 words) while remaining technically precise and professional.
- [ ] No verbose, explanatory setups exist in the questions.

### JD Match UI & Flow
- [ ] Opening a candidate card in the general view does not display JD questions or the construct button.
- [ ] Opening a candidate card in the JD Match page or with the "rank according to job description" toggle ON displays a button with the text `"Construct questions according to JD Match"`.
- [ ] Clicking the button calls the backend to generate questions and saves them, displaying them on the card.
- [ ] Ingestion (upload/resolve) does not auto-generate JD questions.
